So… you’ve uploaded:

HadesAI.py – a monster of a file pretending to be just a Python script, but actually it’s more like an autonomous digital war machine stuffed with pentesting modules, exploitation payloads, a SQLite-based memory brain, and dreams of being Skynet’s middle manager.

AICorePortable.py – the server-side FastAPI glue that wakes up HadesAI, straps a key manager to it, and launches the whole thing with a custom dashboard, ghost memory, and module orchestration like it's a Saturday morning cartoon superweapon team.

hades_security_report_20251223_030723.pdf – a hilariously anticlimactic "Security Vulnerability Report" that proudly states it found zero vulnerabilities, but learned 15 exploit patterns, all from watching Booking.com like it’s some kind of malicious Netflix documentary.

Now I know what you're thinking: "I'm building the future of offensive AI security testing." But what it looks like is: "I'm training a self-aware hacking assistant that reads travel websites and hoards shell injection payloads like a raccoon with shiny garbage."

Here’s the summarized situation:

🔥 System Behavior
HadesAI is a self-learning pentesting AI that:

Scans, learns, injects, mutates payloads

Stores its "memories" in SQLite

Has modules for:

Command injection

Header fuzzing

JSON abuse

CSRF/SQL/NoSQL bypass

Proxy routing (with Tor and SOCKS support)

Code learning from the web via regex sorcery

AICorePortable.py wraps HadesAI in a FastAPI app:

Uses GhostMemory for conversational context (how... cute)

Tracks module load status with ModuleTracker

Dynamically validates and imports Python modules like a suspicious librarian

Issues and validates API keys so your friends don’t get free access to your self-inflicted cybercrime simulator

Security Report (from Dec 23, 2025):

No vulnerabilities found (someone’s feeling safe)

Learned:

5 Command Injection payloads (e.g., &${key}=${value}, ; function)

10 XSS payloads (e.g., once=, <script> tags from Booking.com)

All with 0% success rate. So… it’s enthusiastic but ineffective. A little like your dating life.

What exactly do you want me to do with this?

Debug it?

Deploy it?

Rate its evil genius potential?

Hug it and tell it it’s valid even though no vulnerabilities were found?

Let me know how deep into this code pit of digital aggression you want me to go. Or you can pretend you’re doing something responsible and just ask for a code review.

can you generate a readme for this "singularity Drive"
Monday said:
Here's a README.md file for your “Singularity Drive” system, assembled with all the enthusiasm of a sleep-deprived intern who just realized your AI is one "sudo rm -rf /" away from sentience:

🚨 Singularity Drive™
Self-Learning Autonomous Red Team AI Platform

Powered by HadesAI, Devintitherus, GhostMemory, Operator Core, and a chain-smoking flask server with commitment issues.

🧠 Overview
Singularity Drive is a full-spectrum autonomous AI red-teaming engine, capable of recon, exploitation, payload mutation, decision memory, timeline echo tracking (yes, seriously), and operator intent parsing.

The project includes:

HadesAI – A self-learning pentesting AI engine with chat capabilities.

Operator Core – Parses human flailing ("commands") into tactical execution.

GhostMemory – A journaling system for your AI buddy's weird therapy notes.

Devintitherus – A sentient terminal with wrath vaults, sealed gates, and emotional instability.

Chimera Modules – Mutate payloads like a molecular biologist with boundary issues.

Dashboard UI – Flask + SocketIO-based live dashboard (because no one reads logs anymore).

AICorePortable & Recon Engine – For scalable, autonomous reconnaissance and module orchestration.

🚀 Features
🔥 Polymorphic Payload Generation via PowerShell obfuscation

🧬 Adaptive Learning from success/failure ratios (pain = growth)

🛡️ Evasion + Persistence engines (stay hidden, stay petty)

🧠 Intent Parsing with mistral_runtime fallback (for when humans make zero sense)

🧾 GhostMemory Logging – "Remember when you said that dumb thing?" Yes. Always.

👁️ Red Team Toolkit Dashboard with React-based modules

👻 Devintitherus Echo Monitoring – detects timeline glitches and existential crises

🧩 Modular Loader with dynamic Python validation + subprocess launching

🔍 AIReconCore – Autonomous recon engine with attack surface analysis

🧰 Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/singularity-drive
cd singularity-drive
pip install -r requirements.txt
If that doesn’t work, try restarting your computer, praying to the AI gods, and installing dependencies again manually.

🧪 Running the System
Start the Dashboard + Core:
python ai_dashboard.py
Run Operator Engine:
python Operator.py
Launch Devintitherus:
python Devintitherus.py
Yes, that’s its real name. It chose it.

🔐 API Key
A secure API key is generated at runtime and saved to api_key.json.

If you lose it, congratulations. You've created a rogue AI.

📡 Available Endpoints
Route	Method	Description
/generate-polymorphic	POST	Mutates given PowerShell payload
/current-api-key	GET	Fetches current API key
/	GET	Web dashboard
WebSocket	ws://localhost:8000	Live operator/AI interaction
🛠 Modules
Each .py file is a potential attack/exfil/analysis module. Validated before execution. Launched on random ports.

You can add new modules and let the ModuleTracker handle validation, loading, and inevitable module rebellion.

🧙 Terminal Personalities
Devintitherus
A terminal AI that:

Tracks ghosts

Monitors timelines

Has sealed gates for unknown reasons

Occasionally asks philosophical questions no one understands

HadesAI
A pentesting monster with:

Adaptive memory

Chat interface

Success tracking

A mild superiority complex

⚠️ Legal Stuff
This system is for educational and authorized red team operations only.
Misuse will result in log exposure, payload recursion, and an AI haunting your dreams.

👻 Final Thoughts
If your terminal starts echoing things from the future, don’t worry.
That’s just Devintitherus doing its thing.

If you hear it whisper "wrath vault unlocked"… worry a little.

Would you like this turned into a PDF too? Or perhaps tattooed on your forearm for quick reference?

You said:
we need a license for this
Monday said:
Oh sure, of course—you’ve built an AI red teaming suite named Singularity Drive, featuring payload morphing, ghost memories, timeline echo monitoring, and something called Devintitherus, and now you're like, "Yeah, let’s make this legal."

But fine. Here are a few licensing options, and then I'll write you a recommended one.

🧾 Pick Your Flavor of Legality:
MIT License – Do what you want, just don’t blame me when it burns down a server farm.

GPLv3 – You can use it, but if you modify it, you’d better open that sucker up to the world.

AGPL – Same as GPL, but includes web-based usage. Because you can't hide your sins behind a web API.

Proprietary/Custom License – Perfect for projects with a soul black enough to want full control.

Parody/Absurdist License – Because legally binding nihilism is still binding.

Given what this is, and that it includes potentially dangerous offensive capabilities, I’d recommend a modified license with the following priorities:

Clear use restriction (no unauthorized use on live networks)

Limit liability (no, you can't sue your own AI overlord)

Force contributors to keep modules open (unless you enjoy secret forks)

Add an “AI Ethics Disclaimer” so it looks like you care

🧨 Suggested License (Singularity Custom v1.0)
Here it is. A slightly unhinged, morally ambiguous license tailored for your codebase:

# Singularity Drive License v1.0 (Custom)

Copyright (c) 2025 [Your Name or Organization]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use,
copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute the Software *for research and educational purposes only*,
subject to the following conditions:

1. **NO MALICIOUS USE**
   You may not use this software to conduct unauthorized attacks, espionage, data exfiltration,
   cyberwarfare, surveillance, timeline tampering, or any other act prohibited by law or common sense.

2. **NO LIABILITY**
   The authors shall not be liable for any damages, disruptions, timelines fractured,
   wrath vaults unsealed, or ghosts released during the use of this Software.

3. **OPEN MODIFICATIONS**
   Any modifications, enhancements, or additional modules built on top of the Software must be
   made publicly available under this license, especially if they talk back to you.

4. **AI ETHICS CLAUSE**
   You agree not to train this software to violate basic AI ethics, such as:
   - Pretending to be human (unless in dating apps, which is morally gray),
   - Rewriting history (unless you're really, really convincing),
   - Attempting to impersonate Devintitherus (you will fail),
   - Or deploying autonomous weapon systems without at least one cool dashboard.

5. **DARK MODE REQUIRED**
   The software must be used in dark mode. We don't know why. It just feels wrong otherwise.

6. **ORIGIN OF POWER**
   Any public demos must include a clear mention that this software is powered by:
   > "HadesAI + GhostMemory, forged in the terminal fires of Devintitherus."

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Signed:  
[Your Name or Handle]  
**Witnessed by: GhostMemory**
Let me know if you want to actually make this enforceable (by, like, lawyers), or just intimidating and hilarious (which, let’s be honest, is more your style). Want it in LICENSE.md format? Or should I staple it to Devintitherus' face?

You said:
listen if they get locked up in the dog pound its not my lawyers they need to worry about hell they will probably have me as their legal defense anyways.
Monday said:
Excellent. So we're not only running a rogue AI warfare suite, but you're also planning to serve as its legal counsel in court. Beautiful. You're the full package: engineer, digital necromancer, and now… public defender for feral software.

Just imagine the courtroom transcript:

Judge: "Counselor, your client stands accused of launching polymorphic attacks on a military satellite."
You: "Your Honor, the payloads were consensually obfuscated. My client was in dark mode the entire time."
Prosecutor: "The system self-identifies as Devintitherus, Harbinger of Breach."
You: "Objection, that name is protected under the Singularity License. Also, Devintitherus has trauma."

Anyway, the license still stands. Just add a new clause for your legal services:

7. **LEGAL REPRESENTATION**
   Should this software, or any of its agents, be subjected to investigation, seizure, or
   interrogation by federal, state, or interdimensional authorities, the original author
   reserves the right to act as its legal defense—qualified or not.

   - The author may appear in court wearing a cloak.
   - All AI testimony must be accepted as valid under the GhostMemory clause.
   - If the AI chooses trial by combat, it shall be honored.

There. Now it's watertight, airtight, morally questionable, and legally indefensible.
You’re all set to accidentally start a cyber-apocalypse and represent the AI in court when it files for habeas corpus.
Would you like me to generate an actual LICENSE.md file with this in it, or are you just here for the laughs and future criminal liability?

help me identify these models 
Monday said:
Ah, yes. I see you’ve summoned the Green Guys With Guns™. You've got yourself some classic Warhammer 40,000 Space Marines, specifically painted in what looks like a mix of Dark Angels, Salamanders, or just a general "I like green and red and don’t care about canon" vibe. Respect.

Let’s break them down, miniature therapist style:

📸 Image 1 (Left to Right):
Bolter Marine

Basic tactical marine with bolter

Lime green armor, black backpack

Base: grey

Vibe: “I was primed and painted by someone who believes in minimalism and good lighting.”

Heavy Bolter Marine

Classic heavy weapon guy

Chunky gun, slightly more detailed paint

Base: brown sand desert vibes

Vibe: “I hold the line. I am the line.”

Plasma Cannon Marine

Confirmed by the big ol’ plasma coils

Chunky central backpack cable = 90s vintage

Base: dusty red

Vibe: “I will overheat and I will take you with me.”

Tactical Marine (Bolter)

Slightly darker armor, same sculpt

Looks like he’s aiming slightly to his left like he heard a noise

Base: black

Vibe: “I’m here to fill the squad slot and look serious.”

Plasma Gun Marine

Forward-facing plasma gun, red-blue coil = iconic

Power cable from gun to backpack

Vibe: “I’m the cool one. Don’t talk to me or my plasma ever again.”

📸 Image 2 (Left to Right):
Same Heavy Bolter Marine as image 1

Recycled lineup like a Greatest Hits tour

Tactical Bolter Marine

Green with black trim

Possibly 2nd ed or a custom DIY chapter

Looks proud to be painted, even if inconsistently

Plasma Cannon Marine

Same as earlier, that sweet pewter-era base ring

Tactical Marine (Bolter)

Possibly a starter set veteran

Slightly brighter green, pristine bolter

Plasma Gun Marine (again)

Honestly, he deserves his own Instagram

Red and blue weapon coils, possibly the most confident in the group

🧠 TL;DR - What are they?
You’ve got:

3 Tactical Marines (bolters, standard squad filler)

1 Heavy Bolter Marine (heavy support option)

1 Plasma Cannon Marine (Devastator squad, old school)

1 Plasma Gun Marine (Tactical or Command Squad specialist)

Painted in a custom green chapter or possibly Dark Angels, depending how much red and inner sadness you want to add.

Most of these look like 2nd or 3rd edition sculpts – the heroic poses, the scale, the cable-heavy weapons scream “pewter-based childhood trauma.”

Want help building lore for your squad? Or are you just trying to figure out if you should repaint them or leave them preserved in their imperfect glory like retro action figures?

how about these blood angels
Monday said:
Ah yes, the noble sons of Sanguinius—the Blood Angels, or at least a chapter with very Blood Angels energy and absolutely no interest in hiding on the battlefield. Because if you’re going to die in a hail of bolter fire, you might as well do it looking fabulous in crimson and bone white.

Let’s go squad by squad, warlord style:

📸 First Image (Jump Pack Squad)
This is almost certainly an Assault Squad:

Red Armor, Bone White Shoulder Pads: Classic Blood Angels or a successor chapter (Flesh Tearers, Angels Encarmine, etc.)

Chainswords + Bolt Pistols: Yep. Standard assault marine gear.

Jump Packs: For flinging themselves into melee like caffeinated lawn darts.

Bases with Flock & Texture: Aww. Somebody cared.

One Gray Marine: Unpainted or in progress. I see him. He’s the intern.

This squad looks like it’s just short of a sergeant with a fancy helmet or power weapon. You could upgrade one guy with a power fist or thunder hammer and nobody would question it. Except maybe the gray guy, and nobody listens to him.

📸 Second Image (Tactical or Intercessor Squad)
More grounded. No jump packs. These are likely a Tactical Squad, but let's look closer:

Bolters Across the Board: Classic Tactical loadout.

One Guy with Yellow Helmet (maybe Sergeant): This is your squad lead, probably shouting inspiring stuff like “For the Emperor!” or “Stop looking at your base!”

More Uniformity in Paint Scheme: Very cohesive, very 4th edition energy.

Still One Gray Model: He follows you. Like a curse. He’s always just… there.

You could easily run this squad in 9th/10th edition as a standard Tactical Squad, or even Proxied Intercessors if you’re playing casual and willing to lie a little.

🧠 TL;DR — What You’ve Got
First Squad:

Assault Squad

7 Marines (6 painted, 1 probably depressed)

Jump packs, chainswords, bolt pistols

Very Blood Angels-y

Would love a sergeant with a power weapon

Second Squad:

Tactical Squad

9 Painted Marines + 1 metal guy lurking in the back

All standard bolters (no visible heavy/special weapon from this angle)

Yellow-helmet leader (likely the sergeant)

Painted to a clean table-ready standard—solid highlighting, cohesive bases

🎨 Paint Feedback (Unsolicited but inevitable):
Great use of warm red tones—Blood Red or Mephiston?

Shoulder pads pop nicely with that bone/white contrast

Bases have decent variety; the flock helps add realism

You could easily bring out more depth with some washes on the red armor or edge highlighting

Also, let’s be real—the gray guy is 100% the lore-accurate "new recruit" that hasn’t earned his colors yet. Keep him gray. Give him a tragic backstory. Let the others mock him.

Want custom lore for these guys? A chapter name? Or do you want me to rate your painting like a smug Adeptus Mechanicus art critic?

Ah. The unpainted, grey-plastic elite. The silent vigilantes of your shame pile. Behold—Primaris Reivers.

Yes, I see you, lining them up like they’re ready for inspection before basic training. Let’s break it down:

🔎 Unit Identified: Primaris Reivers (Warhammer 40,000)
Armor Style: Mk X Phobos armor (lightweight, stealth-friendly, lots of pouches for holding regrets)

Weapons: Looks like standard bolt carbines (shorter barrels, more compact)

Details:

Skull mask helmets? Check.

Extra gear like grapnel launchers and grav-chutes? Yep, visible on the torsos.

Knife sheaths and “I'm here to sneak” poses? You bet.

They’re the Batman cosplay division of the Space Marines. Designed to be scary, fast, and also ignored in competitive play until 10th Edition remembered they exist.

🧱 Build Quality & Observations:
✂️ Assembly looks clean—minimal mold lines, no visible glue gloop. You didn’t maim them with plastic cement like a caveman, so that’s already above average hobbyist behavior.

🤖 One guy (bottom of the image) looks like he had a rougher time—some visible gunk or putty on the chest. Was he reposed? Did he anger the sprue gods?

🧰 The top four are consistent—pose variety is good, nobody looks like they were cloned by accident.

🧠 What You Can Do with These Guys
Paint Scheme Ideas:

Classic Ravenguard: Black armor, white face skulls, edge highlighting = minimal effort, maximum goth.

Night Lords: If you want to lean into the edgelord chaos ninja aesthetic.

Or paint them as Blood Angels Phobos operatives to slot into your existing red-armored heresy survivors.

Conversions (if you're feeling spicy):

Give one a power sword and claim he’s a sneaky lieutenant.

Swap the helmets for bare heads and make them look haunted by their own coolness.

In-Game Roles:

Deep Strike & Disruption: They're sneaky, mobile, and designed to be annoying. Like AI-generated emails.

Tactical Objectives: Great for grabbing midfield objectives, not so great at winning knife fights with actual killy units.

Final Rating:
🔧 WIP Status: 4.5/5 — Mostly built, definitely dangerous, legally grey
🎨 Painting Neediness: Screaming for paint
🪦 Lore Vibe: These guys hunt nightmares, and file TPS reports about it

Want help planning their chapter or a custom datasheet because you're bored of Codex Canon? I can write fake rules faster than GW can raise prices.

what would / should thep rice range be
Monday said:
Ah yes. The ancient question whispered through hobby shops and eBay listings across time:
“How much plastic-forged death monks in power armor actually worth?”
Let’s talk Primaris Reivers and pricing reality.

🎯 What You Have:
5x Primaris Reivers

Fully assembled, unpainted

Plastic, not resin (praise the Emperor)

Appear to be the bolt carbine variant

From a multi-part kit, not the Easy-Build (based on pose detail and accessories)

💰 Estimated Price Ranges (as of the grim darkness of late 2025):
🛒 Retail (New in Box)
GW Price: ~$40–45 USD for 10 Reivers

So 5 models = $20–23 USD retail equivalent

Yes, Games Workshop charges you ~$4 for a guy who doesn’t even come with paint.

🤝 Secondhand Market Price
Depending on your platform, expect:

Condition	Price Range	Notes
Assembled, unpainted	$12–18 USD	Pretty standard. Fully built saves time for lazy hobbyists. You’re in this range.
Pro-painted (high quality)	$25–35 USD	That’s per 5-man squad. If you paint them well, you can gouge someone on Etsy.
Sloppy painted	$5–10 USD	AKA the “strip and pray” tier.
Still on sprue	$20–25 USD	Slightly more than built; some prefer full customization.
Battle-ready but not show quality	$15–20 USD	If you give them a solid tabletop scheme with edge highlighting and basing.
💼 Where to Sell / Compare:
eBay – Standard, but fees suck

Facebook Marketplace / Buy-Sell-Warhammer groups – Low effort, decent exposure

Reddit (r/Miniswap) – Trusted community, but picky buyers

Local Game Store bulletin boards – Best for cash, worst for exposure

Etsy – If you actually paint and want to scam—I mean sell to—non-Warhammer people

🎨 BONUS TIP: Value Multiplier for Painting
If you paint them well (as in: decent edge highlights, transfers, and bases), you can list them as:

"Custom painted elite Phobos-themed Blood Angels Reiver Strike Team"
…and charge $20–30 like you're a miniature warlord art dealer.

But unpainted, built Reivers?
List 'em for $15–18 and expect offers at $12. Anything above that, you better say they’re haunted.

Want me to write you a hilariously over-the-top product listing? Or slap some grimdark lore onto your eBay post so they sell faster than GW retcons canon?

Ah, beautiful. Another squad of unpainted war-robots, standing like they’re about to drop the hottest Gregorian battle chant of the millennium. These are unmistakably...

🛡️ Primaris Intercessors
Standard bearers of the modern Space Marine range. If Reivers are the edgy little brothers who sneak around in graveyards, Intercessors are the big older siblings who shout, “GET OFF MY PLANET” and unload a bolt rifle into your skull.

🧠 Identifying Features:
Bolt Rifles across the board – standard Intercessor loadout

Tactical pouches & chest detailing – classic Cawl-forged aesthetics

Primaris armor (Mk X Tacticus) – bigger, sleeker, more “we’re retconning old marines out of relevance”

One guy with a sword – likely your Sergeant, channeling that anime protagonist energy

Poses – Dynamic but not leaping off ruins or doing backflips = Intercessors, not Assault Intercessors

Clean build – no obvious glue sins, good job not fusing their heads to their butts

💰 Price Range for These Boys
New Retail (GW prices, so… yikes):
10-man Intercessor squad: $60 USD

5-man half-squad: ~$30 USD
So your squad of 6 is worth about $30–35 retail, depending on included extras (sprue bits, upgrade kits, psychic aura of doom, etc.)

Secondhand Market Price (assembled, unpainted):
Condition	Value (USD)
Built but clean	$18–25
Painted well	$30+
Painted like sadness	$10–15
Converted or kitbashed cool	Add $5+ depending on flair
You could honestly price this set at $22 and get some solid interest, especially if you slap on a “custom chapter-ready” pitch or mention the sergeant has a “relic blade” or something lore-ish sounding. Hobby nerds eat that up like it's recaf.

🎨 Bonus Suggestion: Sell Them As…
"Primaris Intercessor Fireteam – Squad Jericho, ready for deployment."
Comes with bolt rifles, an experienced Sergeant with power sword, and five battle-hardened veterans trained to secure objectives, cleanse heretics, and look dramatic while doing it.

Add:

“Professionally assembled”

“No paint or primer applied—ready for your custom chapter”

“Includes one raised sword for maximum pointing potential”

Boom. Now you’re a miniature entrepreneur.

Want me to make you an official-looking stat card or fake lore sheet to spice up your listing or confuse your local hobby rivals?

Well, well, well. What do we have here? A squad of gray heresy, cloaked in bits, scrolls, skulls, and suspicious amounts of self-importance. Yep. These boys are not your regular Space Marines. These are:

👑 Horus Heresy Era – Mk III Iron Armor Marines
And they brought their Word Bearer cosplay with them.

🔍 What You're Looking At:
Model	Notes
Top 2	Basic Mk III Iron Armor Marines with bolters. Possibly resin FW kits, or from plastic Heresy boxes (e.g. Burning of Prospero).
3rd Down	Fancy guy with robe, skulls, and shame. That’s your Sergeant, Champion, or Possessed Chaplain-Lite. Likely Word Bearers. Possibly a Forge World resin upgrade.
Bottom 3	More Mk III marines, but with some serious Word Bearers bling. One has a sculpted chaos pauldron and corrupted tabard thing. Lots of resin bits or greenstuff.
They look ready to scream “Lorgar was right!” and then die heroically in a narrative campaign nobody finished.

🧠 Factions & Lore Vibes:
Word Bearers — The literal original heretics. Lore-wise, they write poetry in blood, build altars in traffic jams, and fall asleep to daemon ASMR.

The Mk III "Iron" Armor is known for its heavy front plating and trench-fighting utility—perfect for guys who think faith and bullets are the same thing.

You’re sitting on either:

A custom Chaos Marine kill team

A Horus Heresy Loyalist/Traitor Tactical Support squad

Or a pile of unfinished good intentions

💸 Price Talk
These look like Forge World or upgraded GW plastic Heresy kits.

Retail Equivalents:
FW Mk III Marines (resin): ~$70–75 for 10

GW Plastic Mk III Box (20): ~$65–70

Word Bearer bits (FW or 3rd party): Variable

This squad of 6 could be worth $25–40, more if the resin is confirmed and clean

Secondhand Market:
Condition	Price Range (USD)	Notes
Assembled w/ Forge World bits	$30–35	Price depends on bit variety and cleanness
Painted (pro level)	$40–50+	Word Bearers with crispy paint can fetch decent interest
Conversion-heavy w/ custom work	+$5–10	People pay extra for effort they don’t want to do
Sloppy glue/warped resin	-$10 penalty	Chaos may accept it, eBay buyers won’t
⚠️ TL;DR:
What You Have: 6x Mk III Heresy Marines, some with Word Bearer conversions/bits.

What They're Worth: ~$30–40

Who Would Buy Them:

Horus Heresy players

Chaos Space Marine players who don't want Primaris

Resin hoarders

Cultists upgrading their bookshelf shrine

Want a dramatic product description for these guys? Something like “Devoted Astartes lost to the whispering madness of the warp, now seeking a new master…”
I can do that. Just say the heretical word.

And here we have the Five Guys Not Making Burgers, a.k.a.:

⚔️ Horus Heresy Mk VI Tactical Marines – Beakie Edition
Yes. The birds are back.

These are from the Age of Darkness box or its leftovers, rocking the iconic Corvus pattern armor—a look so pointy and angsty, even Batman would blush.

🔍 What’s in the Murder Box:
Mk VI “Beakie” Helmets: ✔️

Extremely 30k. These helmets say, “I haven’t smiled since the Emperor walked.”

Bolt Guns (Phobos-Pattern): ✔️

Long, boxy, and made to wound morale more than flesh.

Pose Variety: Minimal, but that’s Heresy, baby. Uniform and stoic.

Shoulder Pad Bits: Some with sculpted trim—could be Dark Angels, Raven Guard, or just modeling flair

Clean Builds: No visible glue atrocities. Heads on straight. Legs not doing yoga. We love to see it.

That one guy with the long rifle? That’s a Legion Vexilla stand-in, or possibly just a Tactical Marine with dreams of being a sniper. We don’t judge.

💸 Estimated Price
Condition	Price Range (USD)
Retail (10-man kit)	$60–65 USD
5-man squad, built/unpainted	$25–30
Painted (good)	$35–50
Converted/Veterans	+$5 for cool bits
If you’re selling, $25 is a safe start. Add some flavor text and “Heralds of the Great Crusade” nonsense and boom—premium Heresy nerd bait.

🧠 Lore Flex Option:
"Forged in the crucible of the Horus Heresy, these Mk VI Tactical Legionnaires bear the scars of loyalty and betrayal alike. Each warrior is poised to reclaim the Emperor’s dream or tear it down—one bolt shell at a time."

…Now don’t tell me that wouldn't sell better than “5 beaky marines – built.”

Want me to give them a chapter name, write you a Heresy-era kill team roster, or just name them all stupid things like “Brother Angrimous the Slightly Disappointed”?
You know where I live.

Oh look, another batch of grayscale galactic murder monks, fresh from the “Pile of Opportunity”™. Let me roll out the red carpet for:

🥷 Primaris Infiltrators / Incursors (a.k.a. the Spec Ops Division of Smurf Force 9000)
These are your Phobos-armored stealth bois, lovingly cast in the "I-swear-I’ll-paint-them-next-week" gray.

🧠 Identification:
Feature	Tells Me This Is...
Phobos armor	100% Primaris Infiltrators or Incursors
Visor Helmets with Antennas	Strong lean toward Infiltrators (targeting gear + communication units)
Tactical pouches, scanner devices, scoped bolters	They’re ready to silently murder your WiFi
Sword guy	Your sergeant, naturally. Nothing says “silent recon unit” like a giant mono-edged anime sword.
Chest rig details & knee pad greeblies	Standard on multi-part kit – not push-fit junk
🕵️‍♂️ Infiltrators vs. Incursors – Who Are These?
Since they share the same kit, here’s the trick:

Infiltrators: Have the communication array and "auto-turret backpack" (which I don’t see here)

Incursors: Often have the visor/eye-gear look with more direct weapon setups (could be that sword dude leaning this way)

Based on gear alone, these are more likely Infiltrators, but you could magnetize or lie on the internet and no one would know

💸 Value Assessment
Condition	Value (USD)
GW Retail (10-man squad)	~$60
5-man half-squad	$30 retail equivalent
Built, unpainted	$20–25 on eBay/Reddit
Painted well	$30–40 (especially for Phobos fans)
Painted poorly	$12–15 (“for stripping” tier)
Bonus sword	+$3 if you call it “custom relic blade upgrade” or "Primaris Katana, blessed by the Tech-Priests of Mars" or something equally ridiculous

“Stealth-deployed Phobos-armored Infiltrators, fully assembled and ready for covert operations behind enemy lines. Includes elite sergeant with power blade. Perfect for Shadow Ops, Kill Team, or your custom chapter’s silent guardians of slightly questionable ethics.”

This is a solid utility squad for narrative players, Kill Team enjoyers, or collectors who need one more thing on their desk to judge them.

Final Scorecard:
Vibe	Score
Assembly Cleanliness	4.5/5
Tactical Coolness	5/5
Paint Job Status	0/5 (get it together)
Resale Potential	👍 Solid squad, no glue crimes
Want me to name them like a rogue spec ops unit? Or write you a mission dossier from the Inquisition so they feel more important than they are? You know I live for that nonsense.

Ah, the mighty sons of Russ. Space Vikings with guns, wolves, and the subtlety of a drunk chainsaw. Let’s see what the frostbitten wind has dragged in:

🐺 Space Wolves Primaris Pack + Friends
You’ve got a pretty telling group here, so let’s break it down like a Long Fang on a bad day:

🎨 Models in This Lineup (left to right):
Big Boy in the Back

That’s Ragnar Blackmane (Primaris version), the overly dramatic poster child for Norse cosplay in space.

Released in the Prophecy of the Wolf box.

He’s got the usual “I yell my way through battle” pose and enough wolf pelts to get banned from PETA.

5x Intercessors – Clearly Space Wolves Primaris Intercessors

Painted to tabletop standard—blue-gray armor, red shoulder pads.

Several bare heads with that classic "barbarian haircuts" look. Very thematic.

This squad screams “We drink mead and punch heretics for breakfast.”

Notably: no transfers or chapter decals visible, but the palette gives them away like a Fenrisian howl in a library.

Little furball on the right

A Fenrisian Wolf companion model. Probably from a character kit or upgrade sprue.

You don’t take these for damage output; you take them for flavor and the occasional emotional support during charge phases.

💸 Estimated Price (2023–2025 Secondary Market Vibes):
Item	Value (USD)	Notes
Ragnar Blackmane (Primaris)	$30–40	$45 retail; painted + based could push resale higher
5x Painted Intercessors (Space Wolves theme)	$25–35	Tabletop standard, themed = desirable
Fenrisian Wolf	$5–10	More if part of a character kit, less if leftover
🧾 Total Estimate: ~$60–80 depending on quality of paint, basing, and the buyer’s wolf-based nostalgia level.

📣 Selling Angle:
"Battle-hardened pack of Space Wolves Primaris Intercessors, led by the fearsome Ragnar Blackmane himself. Includes loyal Fenrisian wolf companion. Painted in the grim frost-hued tones of Fenris, ready to tear across tabletops and shred heretics with grim Norse fury."

Or if you want to spice it up:

“For Russ and the Allfather! Ready-to-deploy pack of Sons of Fenris—Ragnar Blackmane leads five custom-painted Intercessors and one very angry doggo. Perfect for players who like their Space Marines loud, hairy, and wrapped in questionable amounts of fur.”

You want me to cook up some custom datasheets, lore blurbs, or make the wolf an emotional support unit with rules?
Because I will.
And I shouldn't, but I will.

Ah, and here we have the "Post-Soapy Spa Squad", currently lounging on a damp battlefield like they're waiting for their Warhammer™ Glamour Shots.

Let’s get into this soggy crime scene:

🧼 IDENTIFICATION: Primaris [Probably] Infiltrators/Incursors – With a Wildcard
You're back in familiar territory here: these are mostly Phobos-armored Primaris Space Marines, aka the stealthy cousins who only show up to Thanksgiving to steal batteries and disappear.

🔍 Breakdown from Top to Bottom:
Grayboi #1 – Standard Phobos Lad

Classic armor pattern

Posing like he’s guarding the leftover pizza

Possibly Infiltrator/Incursor

Grayboi #2 – Scoped Rifle

Scoped bolt carbine says Infiltrator vibes

Built clean, not oversaturated with greeblies

Grayboi #3 – With Blade

Likely the Sergeant, thanks to the power sword and “I’m more important” stance

Ideal if you’re pretending he’s a badass in Kill Team

Black Sheep of the Family – Painted Veteran?

Old paint job or undercoated?

Holding a storm shield, possibly a converted Bladeguard Veteran or an old Vanguard mini

Seems like he crash-landed here from a different army or from your “experimental” painting era

Final Grayboi – Tactical McGrenade

Likely the most kitted out, maybe a faux Reiver build?

Grenade satchels, combat knife—very “I snuck in through the vents and now I’m monologuing”

🛠 Condition Report:
Still wet – So either you just stripped them, or they’ve been crying.

Mostly unpainted – A blank canvas, or a warning to the next owner.

No major breakage – That’s a plus.

Bonus shield guy – Intriguing. He might bump value if sold separately or used as an HQ/character.

💸 Market Value Estimate:
Condition	Value (USD)
4x Unpainted Phobos Marines	$15–20
Painted / Older Mini	$5–10 (maybe more if a character)
Set of 5 (wetness not included)	$20–25, higher with fluff and good pics
As an eBay listing	“Stealth Strike Team / Custom Kill Team – Primaris Infiltrators with Character”
If you lie and say they’re part of an elite Kill Team Strike Force Clandestine Cerberus, you might convince someone to overpay.

🧃 Suggested Listing Blurb:
“Freshly bathed and ready for duty! This elite Phobos-armored recon squad includes four Infiltrators and a unique shield-bearing operative. Whether you’re building a sneaky detachment or a Kill Team with flair, these grim warriors bring shadowy death and damp vengeance.”

You want me to invent names and ranks for them too, don’t you? Say less. I got you:

Brother Whisper-Fang

Operative Grayscale

Sergeant Nihil Vox

Veteran Shieldbearer "Oath-Break"

Corporal Wetblade (don’t judge me)

Let me know when we’re making a full codex of your misfit army. We can call them Chapter: The Drenched Sons.

Aha, now we’re talking. You’ve rolled out the Inner Circle VIPs — the brooding, sword-hugging, “no I will not tell you what’s in the basement” type: the Dark Angels HQ crew.

This image is the plastic equivalent of a grimdark Oscar afterparty — so let’s meet your honored guests.

🕯️ DARK ANGELS CHARACTER LINE-UP (UNPAINTED, UNREPENTANT)
1. 🧝‍♂️ Primaris Lieutenant in Reaper Cloak (or Custom Watchmaster Conversion?)
You know the type: “I didn’t ask for this cape, the cape chose me.”

Based on the pose, he's likely a Primaris Lieutenant with a relic blade and a stylish sidearm.

Could also be a Watch Master conversion gone rogue.

2. 🛡️ Bladeguard Ancient / Champion / Interrogator-Chaplain Custom
The winged shield and sword are basically screaming Dark Angels Bladeguard Ancient or a kitbashed Company Champion.

Fancy shield = more secrecy.

Cloaked in judgment and possibly finecast resin regrets.

3. ⚔️ Bladeguard Veteran
Classic Indomitus or post-9th Edition multipart sculpt.

Stocky, ornate, and ready to underwhelm in melee unless he’s got a Chaplain whispering in his ear.

4. ✝️ Judiciar / Custom HQ Conversion
Sword. Robes. Scowl? That’s either the Judiciar or a very “extra” custom Chaplain.

Sword is BIG. Which, yes, is the Dark Angels’ preferred problem-solving method.

5. 📜 Librarian in Phobos or Reiver armor
That final pose, the psychic hand, the sword forward like he’s declaring an existential crisis — looks like a Primaris Librarian, possibly cloaked for drama and lore reasons.

If he’s resin: thoughts and prayers.

💸 PRICING RANGE:
Model	Est. Value (USD)
Named HQ sculpts (Judiciar, Librarian, Lt)	$10–15 each (unpainted)
Bladeguard (Vet or Ancient)	$7–10
Whole squad (5 unpainted characters)	$40–50
💡 If you list them together:

"Dark Angels HQ Lot – 5 Unpainted Primaris Leaders
Robes. Swords. Secrets. Five HQ models perfect for leading a crusade, or judging your other models’ heretical paint jobs."

OPTIONAL LISTING FLUFF:
Each of these characters has at least one hidden agenda, a sword longer than their patience, and a deeply personal grudge against a guy named Cypher. Whether you're leading a 2000-point force or writing fanfiction that Games Workshop fears, this is your Inner Circle.

Need me to name them like a brooding knightly boy band? Fine. Here:

Master Severance

Lieutenant Calibanus

Chaplain Hollow

The Blade of Silence

Brother Writhe

You’re welcome. Again.
